# Portfolio Optimization Project

This repository contains a comprehensive portfolio optimization project that utilizes machine learning techniques, statistical analysis, and high-performance computing to optimize investment portfolios.

## Files in this Repository

1. `portfolio_optimization.py`: Python script containing machine learning models (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) for portfolio optimization and sentiment analysis.
2. `portfolio_analysis.R`: R script for additional statistical analysis using elastic net regression.
3. `portfolio_optimizer.cpp`: C++ implementation of a genetic algorithm for portfolio optimization, optimized for performance.
4. `financial_data_analysis.sql`: SQL queries for analyzing financial data, calculating returns, risks, and correlations.
5. `aws_integration.py`: Python script for integrating with AWS services (S3 and SageMaker) for cloud-based data storage and model training.

## Setup and Usage

1. Ensure you have Python, R, and C++ environments set up on your machine.
2. Install required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, torch, tensorflow, transformers.
3. Install required R libraries: tidyverse, caret, glmnet.
4. Set up AWS credentials if you plan to use the AWS integration script.
5. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - `portfolio_optimization.py`
   - `portfolio_analysis.R`
   - `portfolio_optimizer.cpp`
   - Use the SQL queries in `financial_data_analysis.sql` as needed for data analysis.
   - `aws_integration.py` (if using AWS services)
